[insert screenshot of final choropleth map]

## Background + Description

The goal of this analysis was to identify which neighborhood in San Diego would be the optimal location to open a new Mexican restaurant using data analysis and machine learning. As the capstone project for my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program, this analysis represents a culmination of various skills learned during the program, including business problem formulation, data collection via API, data cleaning/wrangling, feature engineering, mapping geospatial data (choropleth, heatmap), K Means clustering, and data science report development.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Folium
* Nominatim
* Foursquare API
* Regex
* K Means Clustering
